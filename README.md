#### It can perform the followng task:

1. **Give list of people** :
	- Who don't follow you back 
		- _Optional-> Unfollow them all_
	- Whom you don't follow back 
		- _Optional-> Follow back them all_


2. **Spamming bot** :
	- It can spam multiple people in a single input with the custom message you provide

<br/>

It saves your user id and password in the same location as your `.py`/`.exe` as `Users.txt`, and don't worry, your user id might be readable to you but password is in the encrypted form

It also saves both of the list of above mentioned people in the form of simple text file.

For your convinience I added another file named `Pyinstaller_python.py` which on running converts the app into an `.exe` file which functions the same and it doesn't even have any prerequisites except for the web driver

It waits for 50 seconds if you have second authorization enabled

*Note: But I suggest you to turn off your double verification if enabled*




-----------------

    Or, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command prompt in the same directory as your `Instagram_bot.py` file

    - If you have Chrome installed in your system then download the [Chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
	- Place web driver and the bot in the same directory or else bot will fail.
