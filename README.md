#### It can perform the followng task:

1. **Give list of people** :
	- Who don't follow you back 
		- _Optional-> Unfollow them all_
	- Whom you don't follow back 
		- _Optional-> Follow back them all_


2. **Spamming bot** :
	- It can spam multiple people in a single input with the custom message you provide

<br/>

It saves your user id and password in the same location as your `.py`/`.exe` as `Users.txt`, and don't worry, your user id might be readable to you but password is in the encrypted form

It also saves a lsit of people following you and people you're following in the form of simple text file (`.txt`) .

For your convinience I added another file named `Pyinstaller_python.py` which on running converts the app into an `.exe` file which functions the same and it doesn't even have any prerequisites except for the web driver

It waits for 50 seconds if you have second authorization enabled

*Note: But I suggest you to turn off your double verification if enabled*




-----------------
